<h1><B>Gailach O'Affrid- A Witchfolk Nursery Rhyme</b></h1>
</br></br>
</head>
<body>
Harken ye, me bairns and wains, </br>
To a tale made dark wit bludstains, </br>
A tale ye myte ha' heared afore, </br>
O' th' boye that lived 'pon Affrid's shore.</br>
</br>
</br>
Th' yonge Gailach, borne of meagre kyn; </br>
His family were but fishermen. </br>
Yet Gailach yearned for somethin' more, </br>
Thenne hooking fish from Affrid's shore. </br>
</br>
</br>
Chetwig Woode, they lived hard-bye, </br>
Soo one nyghte 'neath a moonful skye, </br>
He fled to Chetwig, kyn foresworn, </br>
And vowed na'er return to Affrid's shore. </br>
</br>
</br>
Twixt gnarled bole and pustuled vine, </br>
'Neath myty oake and nettled pine, </br>
Th' yonge Gailach fled to his doom, </br>
In Chetwig's greene bedevil'd gloom. </br>
</br>
</br>
Ere dawn he came upon a glede, </br>
Where bale-eyed beaste and gray wolf bayed. </br>
Wyth offal were the boughs festooned, </br>
In Chetwig's bleke bedevil'd gloom. </br>
</br>
</br>
Man-shaped goats and three-eyed beeves, </br>
Held coven 'neath the oaken leaves, </br>
Warped beastes gambol'd 'neath the moon, </br>
In Chetwig's dread bedevil'd gloom. </br>
</br>
</br>
In their midst was ruin'd throne, </br>
Made o' flesh and twig and bone. </br>
'Pon it was a bloat'd drake; </br>
Benyght'd mystress of the brake. </br>
</br>
</br>
Gailach had no spere nor sworde, </br>
To parry fange nor horn nor gore. </br>
As they circled, th' boye quaked, </br>
Afore the horrors of the brake. </br>
</br>
</br>
The swollen serpent croak'd and rasp'd, </br>
And belch'd forth a fetid gas. </br>
Gailach, engulf'd, began to shake, </br>
And then collaps'd within the brake. </br>
</br>
</br>
Th' yonge Gailach crawl'd to the throne, </br>
His bones and skin all warp'd and torn. </br>
Changed by the fug, th' newe beast spake, </br>
To his newe god, queen of the brake. </br>
</br>
</br>
“Bid me, mother” spake he to her. </br>
Perched 'pon her throne, the devil purred, </br>
“Cavort with thy kyn 'twixt the blooms, </br>
In Chetwig's feye bedevil'd gloom.” </br>
</br>
</br>
One more beaste among bestial host, </br>
Th' boye, changed, is forever lost. </br>
And Gailach returned nevermore, </br>
To his kyn 'pon the Affrid's shore </br>
</br>
</br>
