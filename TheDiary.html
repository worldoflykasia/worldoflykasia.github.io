Captain Ioan, </br>

We found this journal among the possessions of a Gnoll tribal during our latest punitive expedition. I pass it along for your review. </br>

</br>
</br>
We left the Priory in a rush today. I’m glad we’re on the road, I was getting tired of sitting around and waiting for work. Plus, our Guild handlers are snotty and annoying. Gareth was late to wake this morning. As usual. He clearly forgot the 10’ pole. Again. It looks like Hamish is still drunk from last night.  </br>
We were drinking at the Black Boar last night when a haggard woman walked in. She was typical of the frumpy local stock; unremarkable but wide enough to pull a plow. We hadn’t seen her before, so when she went up to the bar I sauntered over and offered to buy her a drink in exchange for news. </br>
Her name was Gwen and she was from a small wood-cutters village on the southern road, between Hlud and Din Hlew. She was just stopping in the Priory overnight, as she was moving to Baerwick permanently. That’s odd, I thought; the Witchfolk are pretty insular and Baerwick is more of a Lloekyri settlement than a Witchfolk one. Something had clearly set her on edge but it was clear it would take some doing to pry it out of her so I prodded a bit further; ‘oh, aye, the Witch Coast is getting dangerous,’ ‘Can’t be too careful in these times,’ ‘We’ve heard some strange tales from those parts, I’d leave too if I were you,’ things like that. No response. I tried to steer the conversation toward the Martyr to see if Gwen had any leads on her relics, but she clammed up at that.</br>
Purely by accident, I stumbled upon the key to breaking her reserved demeanor. I was talking to Hamish and said ‘We should grab some food from Dyrgi’s, the dwarf has good rolls’ when Gwen leaned forward and nervously stammered ‘Did you say Gnolls?’ And that was that. </br>
Everyone knows the hills of the Black Rhews are swarming with Gnoll tribes. Gwen was from near there and her people have had occasional contact with the Gnolls; sometimes good, more often bad. What most don’t know is that the Gnolls seem to worship something called The Maze. Apparently it appears only on The Unnamed, the extra day tacked onto the end of the New Year’s Festival every four years. Although I’ve never ascribed to the fiendish connotations attached to The Unnamed, it’s always creeped me out; the Moon is way too big and looming. Anyhow, according to Gwen every few decades or so The Maze sticks around longer than just the one day, and it causes all sorts of frightful stuff. She mentioned swarms of birds fighting in the sky, wells drawing up blood instead of water, talking faces appearing in the knots of her house’s clapboard walls. Gwen said The Maze is still out and about, even though it’s already 3rd Month, and the strange signs are getting worse, so she’s decided to up sticks and move. </br>
I asked her what The Maze is. She wasn’t sure, exactly; she hasn’t seen it herself but her nan has. Her nan described it as a big stone labyrinth the size of a town that flickers insubstantially. She said that when her nan was young some adventurers went inside but they never came out. Her nan said that <i>her</i> nan told her there were four things inside, she called them anchors, that The Maze hooks into Valth during The Unnamed to try to stay rooted to the planet. She also said fiends lived in the labyrinth and break out while The Maze is on Valth. Gwen seems to think the world is about to come to an end because of the fiends and The Maze and the funny well water.</br>
After a brief conference with the boys, I told Gwen that we would look into it. Honestly this didn’t seem like anything beyond the ravings of an agitated bumpkin, but the Guild wasn’t throwing any leads on Relics to us and I thought that if this ‘The Maze’ was real there may be treasure inside. Gwen thanked us but seemed dubious there was anything we could do about it. Kind of ungrateful if you ask me. </br>
</br>
</br>
Made it to Din Hlew, the trip was uneventful. I’ve been to this city several times but still haven’t made up my mind about it. Everything is sort of gray; the walls, the people, the food. It’s like the physical manifestation of ‘meh.’ </br>
</br>
</br>
Today was an odd one. We were traveling through the Rackwoods when we came across a strange animal. It looked like a lean bull, but it’s horns curved backwards like a ram’s and it had a long mane like a horse. Hamish thought it might be magical, like a unicorn, so we reverently approached the beast. Well, the skittish creature took off into the woods like a bolt of lightning. We gave chase as fast as we could, but the thing started… voiding its bowels. The excrement shot out of the creature like a ballista bolt. Hamish took a pie directly to the face so Gareth and I started laughing. We stopped once Hamish screamed; the shit was burning through his skin like a hot knife through butter. We scraped it off as best we could and made for Hludd. Hopefully they have a healer.</br>
</br>
</br>
We found the healer in Hludd and spent the past week in the mining town while Hamish convalesced. Turns out the shit-launching creature is called a Bonnacon and the Rackwoods are lousy with them. </br>
While Hamish was getting healed, Gareth and I asked the people of Hludd (Hluddites? Hluddlians?) about The Maze. Several were aware of it and more or less confirmed Gwen’s story. I’m starting to believe Gwen more now, as it seems like The Maze has gotten its hooks into Hludd as well; there were two riots and a house-burning during the week we were there. No one knew how to find The Maze, only that the Gnolls worshipped it.  </br>
One of the local folk trades with a nomadic Gnoll tribe called the Green Tusks. He drew us a map to their spring camp. So now we’re somewhere in the Black Rhews and I’m starting to suspect the guy drew the map with west at the top instead of north. I think we’re getting close to the Gnolls as we keep finding the ‘ghost fences’ that the trader told us about. They’re these strange wattle fences with deer skulls mounted on the posts and bird bones woven into the twigs. I guess they’re supposed to ward off evil spirits but they’re deeply unsettling.</br>
</br>
</br>
Well, we finally found the Green Tusks. We traded some daggers and Hamish’s old gorget to them in exchange for a few blankets and torches. They have invited us to stay a few days. There’s a celebratory feast tomorrow night before the Green Tusks move to their summer hunting grounds. We haven’t broached the subject of The Maze just yet; Gareth rightly suggested we play it cool at first before pumping them for information. We decided to ask them about it at the feast.</br>
</br>
</br>
Ugh, my head.</br>
We had the feast last night. It was about midnight when we finally asked about The Maze. We were sat next to the chief during the feast, and after several bowls of mead I decided to ask him. “I have heard of this holy site called The Maze. Do you know of this place?” The moment I mentioned it the music stopped. The Gnolls froze and just stared at me. Some of them started to growl. The chief slowly put his bowl down and started to cackle. His red eyes darted to me and narrowed, the chief still cackling as he appraised me. After a minute of just staring at me and laughing, he nodded and let out a yipping noise. He rose and bid me, Hamish, and Gareth to follow. </br>
He took us to a low hut covered in birch bark and led us inside, his personal guard bringing up the rear. There was a palpable tension in the air and I was convinced we were done for.  As my eyes adjusted to the smoky gloom inside the hut I saw a Gnoll lying on a reed mat. He was emaciated and bent. Most of his fur and teeth were missing. The chief introduced us to the Green Tusk shaman, and I sensed a fearful respect in the chief.</br>
The chief quickly spoke in the barking and braying language of the Gnolls. The shaman nodded and stared at us with his rheumy eyes. Still lying on the mat, he opened a gourd that he was clutching to his breast and poured a strange oily liquid into a bowl. The shaman spoke in broken common; “Ten drink.”</br>
Hamish, Gareth, and I each took ten gulps from the bowl. I looked at my friends and saw their pupils were dilated. I looked at the Gnolls and saw the individual hairs of their fur squirming like tentacles. The shaman gestured to the tent flap, so we stood on shaky legs and stumbled out. </br>
There, just on the edge of the camp, was a massive, windowless structure made of huge, close-fitting stone slabs. The stones wept an oily moisture, and I had a sinking feeling that the fluid was what we just drank. The walls were easily as tall as the Priory, or taller. There was an opening through the wall of stone just steps away from us; the entrance to The Maze. I peered through the opening and saw a labyrinth of oily stone walls. A pall pulsed out from the opening, it felt like The Maze was inhaling all hope and joy from the world and exhaling dread and fear.</br>
As we watched, ensorcelled by the sudden revelation, the structure flickered and disappeared. I blinked and looked at my friends again and saw their pupils were back to normal. We silently returned to our tent, heads pounding, and without a word between us fell asleep.</br>
</br>
</br>
We visited the shaman again this morning. The camp is being packed up to move to the summer grounds, but I was able to persuade the chief to ask the shaman to let us take ten drinks from the potion again. Once more our eyes dilated and saw beyond the world. Once more The Maze appeared, breathing in the aeons.</br>
As one we gripped our weapon hilts and stepped into The Maze. Immediately upon crossing the threshold we were assaulted by a kaleidoscope of sounds, each rolling over and past the last, each warping to consume the volume and pitch of the next and then spiraling to silence, over and over. We pushed on, wincing, along a corridor. Ten steps we took, and the corridor opened into a chamber. </br>
The chamber was empty save a single flower sprouting from the stone floor. The flower had ten buds, each with ten stamen, each capped with ten granules of pollen. In a pique I grabbed the flower and pulled it out. Its roots looked like ten human fingers, all grasping at me. Hamish screamed and pointed at the hole in the floor that once held the flower; there was a huge eye peering through it like a peephole. A booming voice joined The Maze’s pervasive cacophony, a laughing voice. The voice tumbled through the Maze’s sonic kaleidoscope, warping and changing. I followed as best I could. It seemed to say “Drsc zvkmo sc xyd pyb iye. Led iyeb gybvn sc pyb wo.”</br>
I blinked, and once more The Maze flickered and disappeared. The Gnolls were gone as well, all that remained was the detritus of their camp. Gareth, beside me, wept in fear. The flower, its human fingers no longer moving, remained gripped in my palm.</br>
</br>
</br>
Gareth and Ham1sh are g0ne. They refused to return to The Maze with me, so now they are gone. Just gone. </br>
No shaman, so no oily nectar. The Gnolls are too far, can’t get 1t n0w. 1 b0iled the flower for ten hours and drank the liquid. The Maze returned, flickering like gossamer, but 1 c0uld hear it and see 1t 0nce again. 1 danced t0 1ts symph0ny in the corr1d0rs and heard the soothing wh1spers 0f the Guard1an, 0nce more intertwined with the mus1c 0f The Maze.  </br>
When The Maze faded 1 felt l0ss, but 1  c0uld still feel its breath upon me and so I shall sleep. Tomorrow 1 will eat the fl0wer and return.</br>
