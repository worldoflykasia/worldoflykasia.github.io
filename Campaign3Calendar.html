After investigating, they determine it is the infant Maya. After leaving, they discover the Everlasting Griffin actually inhabited his pet Mastiff, Talon.</br>
<b> 2nd day of 6th Month, 587 CE: </b> On Lord Dhargey's direction, the party entered a mine on the Lhosan plateau. This lead to a natural chimney leading to the Shadowreach. They were told this was a shortcut through the mountains that would take them to Kharadar's palace at the base of the Celestial Bridge. </br>
<b> 4th day of 6th Month, 587 CE: </b> The party reaches Kharadar's palace. After a fierce battle, they slay the demon Kharadar and restore the celestial bridge, reconnecting the gods to Valth.

Kharadar's palace crumbles, and her followers flee to brood once again in the dark places of the world. </br>
By killing Kharadar and destroying her palace at the base of the Celestial Bridge, the party has allowed the spirits of the dead to enter Heaven. They meet with Angmin, and with Skar acting as interpreter the God of Gods grants the party a boon. At the party's request Angmin will cure the Doom of the Elder Races over generations. In the meantime, he will allow them to live in the Dawnlands, a continent to the east that is cut off from Lykasia. </br>
<b> 5th day of 6th Month, 587 CE: </b> The party travels to Baelirion where they are greeted reverentially by the elves. Alec and the Thindorei of Gael Tholiad, Veriel, have found the zombie of Nephlonna. They had found a way to return her soul to her ravaged body, but it requires the rendered tallow of a creature that regenerates. They find a nest of vampires outside Tarnauk. They slay the creatures and use their fat to render the needed tallow. </br>
Through a complicated ritual, the party, Alec, and Veriel are able to restore Nephlonna to the living. She chooses to rejoin the party.</br>
<b> 6th day of 6th Month, 587 CE: </b> The party transits via trees to the battlefield outside Lublask, capital of Vistla. They find the army has been ravaged in a battle outside the walls, but it is prepared to storm the city. Frost King Pazov plans to sacrifice himself to bring down the ice walls of the city, but the party stops him. They reveal that Ema Khulara expected this and plans to control his heir, Princess Renata, and rule Vistla through her. </br>
Pazov instead instructs Sir Yon, the leader of the Ganzoi contingent of the Allied Army, to lead the vanguard into the city so they bear the brunt of the Juklander attacks. The hot-headed Sir Yon readily agrees.</br>
<b> 7th day of 6th Month, 587 CE: </b> Elrohir creates a portal that allows approximately 1,200 Ganzoi access to the city. They march to attack the artillery nests scattered on the west side of Lublask while the party destroys the orbs creating the undead that infest the ruins. The army comes under intense attack from the artillery sites, while the party goes first to the garrison, then to the palace, and finally to the ruins of Lublask University to destroy the orbs. </br>
Along the way, they learn that a member of the resistance, Bors Zigisyn, fed the party false information and spied on them for the Juklanders. He did this because his sister and her children were taken hostage by the Juklanders. In the garrison, the party slew the leaders of the Juklanders, the twin fire mages Huthr and Kjartan.</br>
While removing the last pockets of resistance in the city proper, Elrohir cast True Polymorph on himself. This ripped a massive hole in the weave that protects Valth from the World Beyond, and the aurora borealis suddenly appeared in the sky. The lights are nearly as bright as the sun, even during the day, and the colors are a raging tempest playing across the firmament.</br>
Juklander Riverwolves reinforce their allies within the city and battle is joined in the ruins of the university. The party and the Blazing Bulwark holds their corner of the ruins through a combination of excellent tactics and judicious spells, but elsewhere the Ganzoi are not so lucky. Even still, the allies win the day and with it, the capital city of Lublask.</br>
Sir Yon, incensed that the Ganzoi took the brunt of the casualties due to the party's allegiance to Vistla, withdrew all Ganzoi forces and headed back to Ganzoria.</br>
The party met with Frost King Pazov and the Goddess Vistla. Speaking through the goddess, Typhan informs the party that it will take him eight days to repair the rend in the Weave and that creatures from the World Beyond will try to enter Valth through the tear and destroy the planet.</br> 
<b> 8th day of 6th Month, 587 CE: </b> The party figures out how to enter the Green Crown. They gather information on the creatures that are coming to destroy Valth: Qokelesh, Tchkchkchk, Khybokh, and Ishaddon. Elrohir learns all spells. Typhan destroys the Green Crown to prevent future arcane magic users from damaging the weave. </br>
<b> 9th day of 6th Month, 587 CE: </b> The party make contact with Liam, who says he can waylay two of the creatures of the party's choice, that way only two will enter the rend before Typhan repairs it. They choose Tchkchkchk and Khybokh. The party enters Gurgamach's realm to enlist his aid, but they discover that he has come under Qokelesh's control. Gurgamach attacks the party; hard pressed, the party flees his realm. </br>
The party determines that they will go to Shefia to fight Khybokh and the gods will fight Tchkchkchk in the Abgrish Ghostlands. The party calls for aid and several allies answer; their troops are teleported to Shefia by the gods. </br>
The party begins preparing Shefia for the coming battle.</br>
<b> 16th day of 6th Month, 587 CE: </b> Khybokh and Tchkchkchk scream through the tear in the Weave, the former slamming into Shefia and the latter smashing into the Hellpit. The party is able to defeat Khybokh, first destroying its corporeal form, then defeating its children as they engorged themselves on its corpse, before finally destroying its dark soul. Huge swathes of the city are destroyed in the battle and many soldiers and allies are slain, but nonetheless the party is victorious.</br>
The party meet with Alec and share how the tear in the Weave occurred; he advises they keep it to themselves. The party hold counsel with Emperor Galdor, Frost King Pazov, and Sir Yon. After multiple snide comments by Sir Yon, Elrohir rebukes him and Sir Yon leaves. The party agrees to meet Pazov in one week to complete the liberation of the Vistlan homeland. The party travels to Ilia forest via Belogost's plant magic. There, they meet the goddess Ilia and the gods Angmin, Hurkwath, and Typhan. </br>
The gods are there to cast judgement on the party's actions. After the party pleads their cases, Angmin pronounces that Thor must live a life of good deeds, Ian must leave Lykasia in 5 years to build a home for the Elder Races in the Dawnlands, and Elrohir will be banished to the moon to slay the demons there; if he survives a year and a day he will be allowed into heaven. </br>
<b> 18th day of 6th Month, 587 CE: </b> The party climb the Kazpak mountains in search of Skritichosk's lair. They discover its lair is a dormant volcano, and they enter. They defeat a group of Ur-Yeti in a room bisected by a jet of perpetual wind, and defeat a family of trolls in a bowl suspended in the caldera and made of clear ice. While debating what to do, Skritichosk's mate shatters the bowl and attacks the party. They arrest their descent using feather fall, but find themselves in a crater </br>
filled with hot water. They battle Skritichosk and her mate deep in her lair. </br>
</br>
</br>
Valth's calendar: The calendar consists of 12 months, each of 30 days. Each month is broken into 3 ten-days. At the end of each year is a 5-day New Year's Festival, each day dedicated to feasting and revelry in the name of the gods. Every four years the New Year's Festival gains a 6th day, The Unnamed. This is the day when the moon is closest to Valth, and its people hide in their homes in terror.
