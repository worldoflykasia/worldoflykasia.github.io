Valth's calendar: The calendar consists of 12 months, each of 30 days. Each month is broken into 3 ten-days. At the end of each year is a 5-day New Year's Festival, each day dedicated to feasting and revelry in the name of the gods. Every four years the New Year's Festival gains a 6th day, The Unnamed. This is the day when the moon is closest to Valth, and its people hide in their homes in terror.
