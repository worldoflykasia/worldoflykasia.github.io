Since then, any attempts at colonization or even attempting to explore the peninsula and contact the Solithans have disappeared. None dare enter Solith anymore.";

These nomads stopped coming to Verenia 400 years ago, and shortly thereafter the tall grasses of the Greensea began to wither and blacken. This destruction heralded the Shrouded, who fell upon Verenia 317 years ago. Now, the magical mountainous barrier known as The Mantle separates Verenia from the Wastes, and the Verenian army keeps a vigilant watch along its ridges to ensure the Shrouded never invade Verenia again.";
