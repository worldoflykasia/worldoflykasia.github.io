The low, humble buildings of Varanash are made of the pink and brown sandstone that is quarried nearby. There are no walls around the city; why would any attempt to attack this holy site?

In response, the High King chartered a new knightly order, known as the Knights of Dawn, and built for them a magnificent sandstone castle on the very edge of the sea. Mounted on Gelar's crenelated walls are several telescopes that can see all the way to the Pirate Isles.

The city saw several periods of rapid expansion, each time the city grew beyond what its walls could hold and resulting in the building of another wall. As a result, the city is a patchwork of wards, each separated by its own walls and gates. Most of the wards have wide cobblestone streets, parks, and white marble fountains. However, the Rookery, a ward just outside the docks, is a haphazard maze of run-down shacks that lean drunkenly over the narrow alleyways. Golnath is home to several prominent noble families who exert considerable power on the city, however the day-to-day life of the average Golnathi is ruled more by the various guilds in town than any nobles.
