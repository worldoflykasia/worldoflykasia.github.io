Several aarakocra eyries dot the lesser mountains and glens of the Godsreaches, united in a small fiefdom ruled by the aarakocra king Garuda, who swears fealty to High King Turan.

Those areas seen by outsiders, though, are resplendent with arabesques and other stoneworks, their quality unrivalled. The dwarves mine the Godsreaches for mithril and iron, exporting arms, armor, and tools.

This serves to protect the Anderghatis from the elements as well as from the Gnoll tribes that infest the Pahari hills. The town acts as a tradestop for the dwarven merchants of Zanakul and those who wish to trade with them. The merchants meet in the Sky Market, a deep, multi-tiered amphitheater dug into the crown of the Anderghat hill and exposed to the sky.

The low, humble buildings of Varanash are made of the pink and brown sandstone that is quarried nearby. There are no walls around the city; why would any attempt to attack this holy site? Its eastern edge is nestled against the holy Segan River, its waterfront a series of sandstone steps that lead directly into the holy river so that the people of Varanash can anoint themselves in it.

When the Verenians came Zelpore resisted, and after a brief but bloody siege they breached the walls and stormed the city, putting thousands to the sword and setting the city aflame. The great Tower of the Seaguard, once a bastion for the people of Zelpore at the heart of the city, was struck by a boulder thrown by Gurkagne's Mistress, the largest trebuchet in Lykasia. The Tower leaned drunkenly for days before finally succumbing to gravity after the Verenians had already left. It fell on the remains of the market quarter, crushing an untold number of Zelpori. Zelpore is a ghost-town now, its few remaining inhabitants struggling to rebuild after the devastation of war.

The fort is incredibly formidable, hosting a large fleet of Ilzuran warships. When the Verenians landed in Ilzura fifty miles south of the citadel, they elected to climb the detta plateau instead of besieging the fort; this is testament to Alkot's strength. The Order of the Western Star sent several squadrons of knights to Zelpore to bolster its defenses, but they were slain to a man in the siege.<br>Population: 1300<br>Leader: Lord Aral Thirn (Human Male)";

During the wet season, great clouds of steam billow along the forest floor, making journeys through the forest even more treacherous.
